## ESP32-CAM Tester

This is a little testsoftware for the OV2640 Camera sitting on the standard esp32-cam board.
It tests if the expected camera signals arrive properly on the board.

Its good to check for hardware problems like bad pin connections etc. and if the I2C Data bus is working.

Maybe the camera itself is faulty, but usually there are bad connections.

Its just a basic terminal application.
